1. Fork JST from here: https://github.com/davidmccoy/jst

2. Go to your JST fork
* copy your ssh key
* ```$ git clone git@github.com:ghostropic/jst.git``` (creates the rails folder)
* make sure you are outside of any other git repos

3. ```$ git remote -v``` (prints to terminal remote repos)

4. ```$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:davidmccoy/jst.git```
* this will make it so you can push __your branch__ to GitHub (similar to homework submission)
* just make sure you push __your branch__ to upstream __your branch__, not to origin
* you can then make a pull request
